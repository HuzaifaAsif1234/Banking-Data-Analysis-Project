# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Banking Dataset using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a banking customer dataset using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to understand customer financial behavior, identify patterns, and extract meaningful insights through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow, starting from data loading and preprocessing to visualization and correlation analysis.

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand the structure and quality of the dataset  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Analyze categorical and numerical features  
- Identify patterns and relationships between financial variables  
- Generate insights that can support business and analytical decisions  

## 🗂 Dataset Description

- **Source:** CSV file (Banking Dataset)  
- **Type:** Structured tabular data  
- **Domain:** Banking / Finance  
- **Features include:**  
  - Estimated Income  
  - Superannuation Savings  
  - Credit Card Balance  
  - Banking Accounts  
  - Saving Accounts  
  - Foreign Currency Accounts  
  - Customer demographic and categorical attributes  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas – data manipulation and analysis  
- NumPy – numerical operations  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization  
- MySQL Connector – database connectivity  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 🔍 EDA Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading

- Loaded CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame  
- Connected Python with a MySQL database to demonstrate database integration  

### 2️⃣ Initial Data Exploration

- Used `.head()`, `.tail()`, `.shape()`, and `.info()` to understand:  
  - Dataset size  
  - Data types  
  - Missing values  

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning

- Removed unnecessary and index-like columns  
- Checked and validated missing values to ensure data quality  

### 4️⃣ Categorical Feature Analysis

- Identified categorical columns dynamically  
- Used count plots to visualize category distributions  
- Helped detect class imbalance and dominant categories

### 5️⃣ Numerical Feature Analysis

- Analyzed distributions using histograms and KDE plots  
- Studied skewness and spread of financial variables

### 6️⃣ Correlation Analysis

- Generated a correlation matrix for numerical features  
- Visualized relationships using a heatmap  
- Identified strong and weak correlations for better feature understanding
